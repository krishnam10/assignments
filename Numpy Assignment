#Import the numpy package under the name np
	import numpy as np

#Create a null vector of size 10
	Z = np.zeros(10)

#Create a null vector of size 10 but the fifth value which is 1
	Z = np.zeros(10)
	Z[4] = 1
	
#Create a vector with values ranging from 10 to 49
	Z = 10 + np.arange(40)
	
#Create a 3x3 matrix with values ranging from 0 to 8
	Z = np.arange(9).reshape(3,3)

#Find indices of non-zero elements from [1,2,0,0,4,0]
	nz = np.nonzero([1,2,0,0,4,0])

#Declare a 10x10 array with random values and find the minimum and maximum values
	Z = np.random.random((10,10))
	Zmin, Zmax = Z.min(), Z.max()
	
	
#Create a random vector of size 30 and find its mean value
	Z = np.random.random(30)
	m = Z.mean()

,,9,10,11

How to read it ?
	Z = genfromtxt("missing.dat", delimiter=",")
